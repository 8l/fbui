First of all, thank you for taking interest in this project!

I have been following the GGI/KGI effort for many years now with a strong interest,
as I see it as the (admittedly long term) ultimate future for console and graphics
subsystems in Unix-like OSes.
However, I never contributed any code to the core projects, mostly due to a lack of
time and ageing programming skills (which date back to my school years!).

But the time had come to give back to the community more than 'thanks for the hard
work'. So I scratched my head and wondered what kind of useful piece of software I
could put together, which would both increase my programming skills to a level where
I can later consider contributing kernel code, and still help the GGI project as a
whole.

A terminal application for GGI fits admirably into this scheme:
- GGI programming
- console subsystem
- use of the Freetype library
- i18n mysteries (conversion between character codes, unicode)
- GNU build tools (automake, autoconf, etc...)

I decided to start from scratch, but used as a source of inspiration an already
existing project: nixterm, written by Andrew Apted. As of today, this project seems
to be abandoned (or considered done) by his author, but I nonetheless would like to
thank him here for the good work he did.
