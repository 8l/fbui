Greetings,

This program, fbterm, is my port of ggiterm to use FBUI, which
is my in-kernel framebuffer GUI. The non-FBUI related code was
written by Aurelien Reynaud. Merci Aurelien!

I used ggiterm because rxvt and xterm seemed more tightly tied to X.
Because fbterm's based on ggiterm, it inherits any minor defects 
that ggiterm may or may not have had. However it basically works well.

To use it, compile it with the makefile. The file libfbui.a is 
expected to be in the parent directory.

Use 'tic' to compile the terminfo file.

Enjoy,
Zack Smith
