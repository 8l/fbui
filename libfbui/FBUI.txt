------ ~ ------

FBUI is based on several vital ideas:

1. bloated programs are hideous, wasteful, stupid and avoidable.

2. a windowing system should never use 20 megabytes,
   as XFree86 does; it is bloated.

3. by putting the GUI into the kernel, an upper limit
   is imposed on bloat in the core GUI code since all 
   kernel code must be small and fast.

4. incidentally overlapping windows were always a bad idea;
   nobody really enjoy shuffling and resizing windows, 
   any more than they enjoy shuffling papers.

5. it's not a good idea to put drivers in userspace,
   which is what X and some framebuffer programs do.

6. having direct fb access may nevertheless be useful

FBUI addresses these ideas in the following ways:

1. abandon X

2. abandon X

3. keep FBUI tiny : it will always be < 32kB for 2-D graphics

4. two solutions:
	a. FBUI allows windows on any virtual console
	b. an OPTIONAL "window manager" process is permitted
	   to move windows around, resize them, and
	   in particular: flip them in and out.

5. FBUI implements basic drawing and allows
   implementation of accelerated routines; however
   even the basic drawing routines are quite fast.

6. FBUI does not impede any application from mmapping
   the framebuffer anyway.
