Greetings,

This is FBUI, whose purpose is to implement an in-kernel 
GUI that offers minimal functionality within a tiny space;
and FBUI Library, which exists to make using FBUI's ioctls
simpler. Why in-kernel? To put a limit on GUI bloat.

FBUI is not intended to satisfy all users' needs.
For instance, the typical home computer user will not want 
to use it since it doesn't support overlapping windows,
which are a bad idea anyway.

However for those of us who accept its limitations
and requirements, and see virtue in its simplicity and
lack of bloat, it may be preferable.

Enjoy,
