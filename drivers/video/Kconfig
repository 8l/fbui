config FB
	bool "Support for frame buffer devices"
	---help---
	  The frame buffer device provides an abstraction for the graphics
	  hardware. It represents the frame buffer of some video hardware and
	  allows application software to access the graphics hardware through
	  a well-defined interface, so the software doesn't need to know
	  anything about the low-level (hardware register) stuff.

	  Frame buffer devices work identically across the different
	  architectures supported by Linux and make the implementation of
	  application programs easier and more portable; at this point, an X
	  server exists which uses the frame buffer device exclusively.
	  On several non-X86 architectures, the frame buffer device is the
	  only way to use the graphics hardware.

	  The device is accessed through special device nodes, usually located
	  in the /dev directory, i.e. /dev/fb*.

	  You need an utility program called fbset to make full use of frame
	  buffer devices. Please read <file:Documentation/fb/framebuffer.txt>
	  and the Framebuffer-HOWTO at
	  <http://www.tahallah.demon.co.uk/programming/prog.html> for more
	  information.

	  Say Y here and to the driver for your graphics board below if you
	  are compiling a kernel for a non-x86 architecture.

	  If you are compiling for the x86 architecture, you can say Y if you
	  want to play with it, but it is not essential. Please note that
	  running graphical applications that directly touch the hardware
	  (e.g. an accelerated X server) and that are not frame buffer
	  device-aware may cause unexpected results. If unsure, say N.

config FB_UI
        bool "Framebuffer UI: in-kernel graphical user interface"
        depends on FB
        default y
        help
          FBUI is a small (25kB) GUI.
	  It was placed in the kernel in order to prevent that
	  it will ever become bloated, as X and other GUIs have.

          FBUI currently allows each process to have one window, and
          windows may not overlap. Each virtual console may have windows.
          One process per VC may request to be a window manager.

          Graphics functions include
                draw point, read point, draw line, draw rectangle,
                fill rectangle, clear window, clear area, draw inverted line,
                put pixels, put RGB pixels, copy area, get event, draw string.

          Fonts supported are monochrome PCF format and they reside in userspace.

	  Both keyboard and mouse input are supported, but you must
	  compile in the event interface (/dev/input/event*) and 
	  the fbui_input module.

          Current sample programs include:
             load monitor, jpeg viewer, analog clock, two window managers,
             screen dump, and terminal.

          on this feature such as the radeonfb, rivafb, and the i810fb. If

          set of values), you'll be able to use any combination of horizontal 
	  and vertical resolutions, and vertical refresh rates without having
	  to specify your own timing parameters.  This is especially useful
	  to maximize the performance of an aging display, or if you just 
          have a display with nonstandard dimensions. A VESA compliant 
	  monitor is recommended, but can still work with non-compliant ones.
	  If you need or want this, then select this option. The timings may

	  Do not forget that second head supports only 16 and 32 bpp

	  WARNING !!! This support does not work with G450 !!!

	  Say Y or M here if you want to use a secondary head (meaning two
	  monitors in parallel) on G400 or MGA-TVO add-on on G200. Secondary
	  head is not compatible with accelerated XFree 3.3.x SVGA servers -
	  secondary head output is blanked while you are in X. With XFree
	  3.9.17 preview you can use both heads if you use SVGA over fbdev or
	  the fbdev driver on first head and the fbdev driver on second head.

	  If you compile it as module, two modules are created,
	  matroxfb_crtc2 and matroxfb_maven. Matroxfb_maven is needed for
	  both G200 and G400, matroxfb_crtc2 is needed only by G400. You must
	  also load i2c-matroxfb to get it to run.

	  The driver starts in monitor mode and you must use the matroxset
	  tool (available at
	  <ftp://platan.vc.cvut.cz/pub/linux/matrox-latest/>) to switch it to
	  PAL or NTSC or to swap primary and secondary head outputs.
	  Secondary head driver also always start in 640x480 resolution, you
	  must use fbset to change it.

	  Also do not forget that second head supports only 16 and 32 bpp
	  packed pixels, so it is a good idea to compile them into the kernel
	  too.  You can use only some font widths, as the driver uses generic
	  painting procedures (the secondary head does not use acceleration
	  engine).

config FB_MATROX_MULTIHEAD
	bool "Multihead support"
	depends on FB_MATROX
	---help---
	  Say Y here if you have more than one (supported) Matrox device in
	  your computer and you want to use all of them for different monitors
	  ("multihead"). If you have only one device, you should say N because
	  the driver compiled with Y is larger and a bit slower, especially on
	  ia32 (ix86).

	  If you said M to "Matrox unified accelerated driver" and N here, you
	  will still be able to use several Matrox devices simultaneously:
	  insert several instances of the module matroxfb into the kernel
	  with insmod, supplying the parameter "dev=N" where N is 0, 1, etc.
	  for the different Matrox devices. This method is slightly faster but
	  uses 40 KB of kernel memory per Matrox card.

	  There is no need for enabling 'Matrox multihead support' if you have
	  only one Matrox card in the box.
